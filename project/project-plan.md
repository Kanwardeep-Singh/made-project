# Project Plan

## Title
Connecting and exploring the insights between different emissions by country with  global temperature statistics.

## Main Question
How does differnt emmissions by the countries overall the world has affected global temperature levels over the years.

## Description
This study aims to analyze the impacts of gobal temperature and  CO2 emissions on global environmental trends. By examining correlations and causal relationships between specific emission practices and temperature metrics, the project will provide insights that could inform sustainable and efficient environmental management strategies.

## Datasources
### 1. Emissions by Country Dataset
- **Source**: [Emissions by country Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022)
- **Data Type**: CSV
- **License**: CC0: Public Domain
- **Description**: This dataset provides an in-depth look into the global CO2 emissions at the country-level, allowing for a better understanding of how much each country contributes to the global cumulative human impact on climate. 

### 2. All Countries Temperature Statistics 1970-2021
- **Source**: [All Countries Temperature Statistics 1970-2021](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdazizulkabirlovlu/all-countries-temperature-statistics-1970-2021)
- **Data Type**: CSV
