# Linking National Emissions to Global Temperature Trends: An Analytical Exploration
The purpose of this analysis report is to establish and analyze the link between diverse national emissions to global temperature change over the course of 30 years.

This analysis tried to resolve the following questions:
1. Out of the all the emissions produced, which emission had the greatest impact?
2. Which country/countries contribute to major temperature change?
3. Is there a direct co-dependency of temperature with emissions?

## Data Sources

-Dataset 1: Emissions by Country Dataset
This dataset provides an in-depth look into the global CO2emissions at the country-level, allowing for a better understanding of how much each country contributes to the global cumulative human impact on climate.

-Dataset 2: All Countries Temperature Statistics 1970-2021.
This dataset provides information on changes in global surface temperature across all countries from 1970 to 2021. It includes data on temperature variations over a 51-year period and is based on information from various sources, including weather stations, satellites, and ocean buoys.

## Analysis

To review the project analysis in detail with figures, please refer to the [analysis-report.ipynb](https://github.com/Kanwardeep-Singh/made-project/blob/main/project/data_analysis_report.ipynb) or the [analysis-report.pdf](https://github.com/Kanwardeep-Singh/made-project/blob/main/project/analysis-report.pdf).

## Conclusion 

1. Out of all the emanations created, carbon dioxide (CO2) by and large has the most noteworthy affect due to its critical commitment to the greenhouse impact and long climatic lifetime.

2. Nations with the most elevated emissions, such as the United States, China, and the European Union, contribute essentially to major temperature changes universally.

3. Thereâ€™s a direct co-dependency between temperature and emissions, where higher emissions, particularly of greenhouse gasses like CO2, lead to increased worldwide temperatures over time.
